			<p>I'm Marrisa,
			I am 14 years old, born on August 11th 2008 in Bangkok, Thailand, 
			but I am Cambodian.
			I lived in Cambodia up until I was 3 years old and then
			my family and I moved to Auckland, New Zealand. 

			It took me a while to adjust to New Zealand because everything and everyone
			is different here in New Zealand.
			I prefer living in Cambodia because of the culture there, but
			my parents moved here because the school opportunities are better.
			I'm currently a year 10 student at Botany downs secondary college and I
			graduate in 2026. this website was created for my 10DIT class in 2023.
